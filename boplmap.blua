-- This is code that runs only on the first frame:
if (FirstFrame == nil) then
    -- Put code here you only want to run one time
    print("Hello from First Frame!")

    FirstFrame = false

-- The main part of the script runs every frame
-- Put stuff here you want running always
print("Hello from every frame!")
